# wm-dotnet-blazor-webassembly

An example project based on two tutorials:

Tutorial 1 - .Net 6 Blazor - Authentication and Role-Based Authorization (using JWT and AuthenticationStateProvider

This adds the basic code for checking a token and making sure that the user has the correct role for viewing certain pages

Tutorial 2 - .Net 6 Blazor - Authentication & Authorization #2 (HTTP Header & NotifyAuthenticationStateChanged())

This adds the backend code for logging in, although the token is still hard coded here. See https://github.com/whackablemole/wm-dotnet-web-api for examples of how this can be done from a simple registration and login process.
